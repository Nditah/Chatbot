## What you will create

In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of building a chatbot that can carry out conversations with users using natural language processing.

To start, we will be using Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model that can generate human-like responses to given prompts. We will be integrating DialoGPT with Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a web application that can communicate with users via a chat interface.

The Chatbot is constructed using the Microsoft/DialoGPT-medium model.
